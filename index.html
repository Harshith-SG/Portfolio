        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi myself Harshith from Gurugram. Grinding myself for jee left me skill-less, hobbyless, friendless, communicationless, basically any other usefull life skill and now here at thapar to finally change that by persuing new areas, exploring myself for new skills and while also doing what I do best and what I love, creating something new. Being an Engineer grants me an abiity to create stuff I want to, let it be hardware or software<br><br></p>
        <p>
            I have already set a foundation stone for a lot of non-technical skills and hobbies and have working on it regularly. I like to watch anime when I am free, and also like to read books.

                <h3>Education and Background</h3>
                <p>
                   Did my 12th from St.Anthony's School Udaipur, Rajasthan in the year 2021. Took a drop for JEE but could not get what I hoped for. After my 12th, I moved to Gurugram and now I am residing there.<BR><BR> After joining Thapar, I feel like I have born again, as I am learning the essential skills required in life from ground 0. Thapar's library is like a heaven for a person like me.

            <div class="cols">
                <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    In my free times, I like to watch anime and webseries. After long years, I have decided to pick up guitar again. At my home, I loved to cook my own food, which only I liked. But the thing with which I kill most of my time is watching youtube. I would love to imagin that I read books in my free time, either fictional or self help, but the reality is I don't and the books I read the most are also known as Mangas. Hit me up if you are planning to play among us or scribbl. I promise to show up everytime.

                <h3>My aspirations</h3>
                <p>
                    I am happy with what I could achieve in my first sem, both in terms of grades and skills I acquired. Keeping up with that, this sem, I would like to indulge more with societies' activities, be the better participating member of the societies I am in. I hope to finish backend by the end of this sem, along with learning premier pro and becoming a better designer. Most importantly, I would like to indulge more on the aspects of public relations.

                <h3>Front-end web development</h3>
                <p>
                    I took a klot of time makinig this portfolio, but I guess it was worth it as I took my time learning html and css and that too to a degree that now I can say that I am good enough to make webpages.

                <h3>Video Editing</h3>
                <p>
                    This is skill on the basis of which I joined EDC. Although I don't use premier pro and all, I can still edit videos and I believe with the passage of time here at EDC, I can hone my skills even better.

                   These are the softwares I learnt when I was managing my finances. I know enough excel to bring upon an output faster than others and enough power bi to make effective and elegant charts and graphs.
